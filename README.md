# mac-setup
This is my personal machine setup, feel free to use, copy, clone, and contribute. 

Note: Pre-requisit = Install XCode via AppStore.

Hope you like it. 

To run download the code and execute 

`./mac-setup.sh`

OR 

use this 1-liner directly from the terminal without even downloading :

`cd /tmp; curl -L -o master.zip https://github.com/smarkovik/mac-setup/archive/refs/heads/main.zip; unzip master.zip; cd mac-setup-main; sh ./mac-setup.sh`
